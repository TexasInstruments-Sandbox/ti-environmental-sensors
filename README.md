## Introduction

`Environmental Sensors from Texas Instruments are specialized sensors used across the industry from Personal Electronics to Medical Devices. These sensors come in a variety of interface types such as I2C (most common), I3C (coming soon), UART, SPI, Analog, Single-Wire and more. These sensors are typically integrated in systems using MCUs to read, interpret and react to measurements read from environmental sensors.

This repository contains a collection of firmware ranging from simple Arduino sample codes to in-depth drivers to provide engineers with an easy design and implementation process.'
